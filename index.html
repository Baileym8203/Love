        You make me laugh you make me smile. your glittery eyes I could stare at forever. I could play
        video games, and watch TV with you endlessly. A day without you makes my heart hurt knowing something is missing.
        No amount of anything could fill that missing void other than you! your love and affection towards me
        always has no bounds. You always go out of your way to make me happy no matter the stresses going on! I see 
        true beauty within your heart, and what I love you most for your personality! 
        
    </p>
    <p class="text-background" id="text-padding">
        You are the most beautiful, most smart, most caring, most loving, most determined in the world! I won't ever want anyone else ever!
        I only want you in my life you are perfect in everyway to me flaws or not I don't care you make my world worth
        living!
        
    </p>

        I have made big mistakes, and I'm sorry for them. I never wanted to make you sad and angry like I have been. I want to make
        you the happiest girl in the world, and lately I haven't been doing the best job at that. With the small arguments about dumb things
        and being rude to you. But all of that changes now!! I'm going to come see you today after school and make it up to you!! There won't be anymore stupid
        small arguments or anymore things making you feel like you need to do something or go somewhere you don't want to go.
        I want to spoil you and make you know I want no one else but you in the world! I love You Chyanne Victoria brown!
        Have a school day at school

        Roses are red and violets are blue no one could ever be as special as you. From the laugh to the 
        smile no one ever comes close to going the extra mile. From the eyes to the hair we could be together anywhere.
        from the bus to the bench when you are close my heart starts to clench. from your arms to your knees nothing could ever be as perfect
        as you with me!
